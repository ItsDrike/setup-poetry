This file serves as a way to explicitly give credit to projects which made `ItsDrike/setup-poetry` possible.

- [**HassanAboulela's setup-python action**](https://github.com/HassanAbouelela/actions/tree/main/setup-python):
  A similar action to this one, which handles installing python, poetry, and project's dependencies.

To all of these projects, they deserve a massive thank you, for keeping their code/information open-sourced and
available as a source of information, and inspiration freely to anyone.
